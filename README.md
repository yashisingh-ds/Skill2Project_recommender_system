# 📌 Skill2Project_Recommender_System
*A system that reads your resume and recommends the best-fit projects using SQL + Python.*

## 🧠 Project Description

**Skill2Project Recommender System** is a personalized project suggestion tool designed to help individuals, especially beginners and job seekers, discover the most relevant and impactful projects based on their actual skill sets. This system extracts technical skills from a user’s resume (PDF/Text) and matches them against a predefined database of real-world projects with their required tech stack. It then recommends projects that align best with the user’s existing capabilities.

Think of it as a smart assistant that reads your resume and answers:  
👉 *“Based on what you know, here are the projects you should build next!”*

## 💡 Why This Project?

As someone starting in Data Analytics, I often found myself asking:  
*"I know SQL and Python—but what project should I build to prove that?"*
Most students and job seekers face this gap between *what they’ve learned* and *what they can build*. Rather than downloading random project datasets, this tool gives **targeted** project recommendations based on your actual resume.

- ✅ Helps in project-based portfolio building  
- ✅ Saves time choosing what to work on  
- ✅ Aligns learning efforts with career goals  
- ✅ Makes your resume + GitHub more personalized and impactful

## 📂 Dataset Used

This project doesn’t rely on public Kaggle datasets.  
It uses **real resumes** (initially my own, and then anonymized samples from my friends from different backgrounds) to:

- Extract skills using Python-based parsing  
- Simulate real-life hiring scenarios for project matching  
- Ensure the recommendations are grounded in actual profiles, not pre-cleaned datasets  

This gave me **hands-on experience** in data extraction, text cleaning, and working with semi-structured data : core skills for any Data Analyst.
